## Behavior-Driven Development

The primary idea behind Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is to define what the
code should do before writing it. BDD is a superset of Test-Driven Development â€“ 
simply redefining the vocabulary from "expect" (TDD) to "should" (BDD). For example,
"Expect 10 to equal 10" compared to "10 should equal 10".
